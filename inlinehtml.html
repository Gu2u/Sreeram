        <p>Who is Raman?</p> 
Born on 24th January 1968 to Mr. L.Subramaniam Iyer and Mrs.Raji Subramaniam as the second son in Palghat , Kerala. 
Called as Sreeram at home as the name given is that of his Maternal Grand father.
Lost his father to brain tumor when he was only 5 years old. His mother joined work and brought up both her sons with struggle.
But he was a bright child with a sharp intellegence and mind of his own not so outcoming,
keeping himself . Life was not easy for him till he joined carpenter apprenticeship at ICF 
since he can think and act without anyone's interference.
Eventhough in a way it helped him to find his passion in photography and a livelihood at a very young age 
the lack of guidance left him to lose the hard earned money in share market, which was his passion.
But these experiences made him a better judge when making investment decisions 
better if not best . He is ever learning.
